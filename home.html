            <div>
                <h5>
					While much of its consists of urban areas and satellite towns, the province does have some gorgeous coastline for you to explore. Negombo’s beautiful beaches, fascinating canal network, and colonial-era landmarks make it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>
                The Southern Province is famous for its wonderful beaches. While each appears more beautiful than the last, those at Hikkaduwa and Unawatuna are particularly delightful.<br>
				Away from its stunning coastline, the province also boasts Yala National Park – the most visited in the country. Here, you’ll find a wide variety of plant life, as well as a host of fascinating animals, such as elephants, leopards, monkeys, and crocodiles. A safari trip to this park is a bucket list affair; nature lovers will find no better place in the country to fulfill their wildlife-spotting desires.

			<h4>Uva Province</h4>
		  </div>
		  <div>
			<h5>
                Nestled away in the southeast of the country, Uva is mostly mountainous. The Haputale and Namunukula ranges run through it, with various rivers and reservoirs also dotted about its landscape.<br>
				As such, the highlands make for a lovely getaway if you’re looking to escape from Sri Lanka’s sun-kissed coast. Among all the tea plantations that blanket the mountainsides, you can find picturesque towns such as Badulla and Ella, both of which are located in very romantic settings.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>
                    Home to two of Sri Lanka’s most ancient kingdoms, North Central Province remarkably boasts over 2,500 years of history, and it is not without reason that it is known as the cultural triangle.<br>
					Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are both incredible places to visit. The two cities are bursting with impressive archaeological sites, with awe-inspiring ruins of palaces and temples almost everywhere you look. Among the many must-see sights are the Bodhi Tree Temple in Anuradhapura and the King Parakramabahu I Statue in Polonnaruwa.

            <div>
              <h5>
                It really is a wonderful part of the country to explore; history lovers, in particular, will revel in the ancient rock temples at Kurunegala and Wayamba, which exhibit exquisite frescoes and centuries-old sculptures. As the province was once home to four of Sri Lanka’s medieval kingdoms, the archaeological sites of Dambadeniya, Kurunegala, Panduwasnuwara, and Yapahuwa are also fascinating to explore; they house incredible ruins of citadels, palaces, temples, and more.

			<h4>Northern Province</h4>

		  <div>
			<h5>
                While its stunning scenery is what many people come for, both Jaffna – the main city in the region – and Mannar, which is located near Adam’s Bridge, are definitely worth a visit; they are both home to lots of interesting historical sights, and proudly showcase Tamil’s rich culture and customs. In addition to this, the beautiful islands of Velanai and Neduntheevu are delightful to explore, with lots of idyllic beaches

					Due to its long and scenic coastline, the Eastern Province is a great place to head if you love watersports, with Arugam Bay renowned for its wealth of great surf spots. As the surrounding area is full of swamps and forests that are home to a stunning array of wildlife, Arugam Bay also makes for a great base if you want to explore the south of the region, as Kumana National Park also lies nearby.

              <h5>
                While it may not boast a beautiful coastline or fascinating historical sights, Sabaragamuwa has more than enough to keep you entertained. Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Udawalawe National Park are two gorgeous parts of the country for you to explore, with lots of impressive wildlife and breathtaking waterfalls to discover.

				Due to its topography and wonderful scenery, the Central Highlands are a great place to go hiking. The Knuckles Mountain Range and Horton Plains National Park are particularly popular destinations, while the sparkling Devon Falls are also well worth checking out.
